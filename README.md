<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Project%20Status-preAlpha-red?style=plastic"/>

A fullstack (web) application to document technical maintenance jobs and generate associated reports.

## Description

This is a project to provide an application for technical field service operatives or in-house service centers to generate and track maintenance reports. The current heavily used solution in the industry is Excel, which (in this authors view) has lost its practicality compared to todays available technologies.

The idea is to provide a modern solution that simplifies any and all tasks related to generating, tracking and distributing maintenance data and reports. Since each company serves different products, the report and data templates in this project serve as an example.

## Planned Features

Initially:

- User (Engineer) can create and submit maintenance reports through forms.
- User (Engineer) can search / review past maintenance reports.
- User (Engineer) can use previous maintenance data to pre-populate new maintenance reports.
- User (Engineer) can request PDF reports from server.
- User (All) has to log into application.
- User (Admin) can search / review all maintenance reports.

Potentially:

- User (Customer) can log into application and review/request his own maintenance data.

## Disclaimer

This is a personal project that is intended to see actual usage at some point but also provide a basis of learning different technologies.
