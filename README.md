## Fullstack project to track and generate maintenance reports.

This is a project to provide an application for technical field service operatives or in-house service centers to generate and track maintenance reports for various devices and systems. The current heavily used solution in the industry is Excel, which (in this authors view) has lost its practicality compared to todays available technologies.

The idea is to provide a modern solution that simplifies any and all tasks related to generating, tracking and distributing maintenance reports.
